# 🧠 CLAUDE MAIN MEMORY – CECI Bot Chain

<small>Last updated: **17 Jul 2025 (Rev‑8 - GitHub Repo Sync)**</small>

1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to tasks/todo.md.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
7. Finally, add a review section to the [todo.md](http://todo.md/) file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.

## 1 · Mission

Answer Hebrew questions about Israeli government decisions through a **unified GPT pipeline**, with **improved quality** and **acceptable cost increase**.

## 3 · Production Deployment 🚀

### Quick Deploy Commands:
```bash
# 1. Commit and push changes
git add . && git commit -m "fix: description" && git push origin production-deploy

# 2. Deploy to server
ssh root@178.62.39.248 "cd /root/CECI-W-BOTS && git pull && docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.prod build [service] && ./run-compose.sh up -d [service]"
```

* **Live Site**: https://ceci-ai.ceci.org.il
* **Branch**: `production-deploy` (ALWAYS use this)
* **Server**: 178.62.39.248
* **Guide**: See `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

## 4 · Cost & Testing Constraints

* **Budget restored**: Allows GPT-4o usage on critical layers
* **New cost structure**: ~\$0.016/query (typical), ~\$0.031/analysis 
* **Architecture tradeoff**: 3x cost increase for 40% latency reduction and superior quality
* **Feature flags**: Enable gradual rollout with `USE_UNIFIED_INTENT` and `USE_LLM_FORMATTER`

### Schema‑Integrity Rule  🔒

> **NEVER change fundamental data types** again – e.g. the `id` field **must stay `UUID4` *as string***. All future PRs touching DB schema require explicit approval.

## 5 · Unified Architecture Changes (10 Jul 2025)

### What Changed?
- **MERGED**: `0_REWRITE_BOT` + `1_INTENT_BOT` → Single **`1_UNIFIED_INTENT_BOT`** (GPT-4o-turbo)
- **UPGRADED**: Code-based formatter → **`4_LLM_FORMATTER_BOT`** (GPT-4o-mini)
- **PRESERVED**: All other bots remain unchanged

### Why?
- **Performance**: Save 200-300ms (one less API call)
- **Quality**: GPT-4o handles Hebrew nuances better than GPT-3.5 + JS
- **Flexibility**: LLM formatter handles edge cases (plural-gender agreement)
- **Budget**: Restored budget allows GPT-4o on critical layers

### Migration Strategy
| Phase | Actions | Timeline |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Phase 1** | Deploy new bots, enable for 10% traffic | Week 1 |
| **Phase 2** | Monitor metrics, increase to 25% | Week 2 |
| **Phase 3** | Validate cost projections, 50% traffic | Week 3 |
| **Phase 4** | Full rollout, archive old bots | Week 4 |

## 8 · Temporary Overrides & Monitoring

* **Evaluator & Ranker** remain OFF unless explicitly required.
* Log `token_usage` & daily spend; alert > \$10 or p95 latency > 2 s.
* Use `SKIP_RANKER=true` env flag for truncating ranker until optimised.
* **NEW**: Monitor unified intent accuracy with `unified_intent_accuracy` metric
* **NEW**: Track formatter quality with `formatter_quality_score` metric

## 9 · Testing Guidelines

* Always test as if a real user inputed through the chat box in the real UI, and check logs
