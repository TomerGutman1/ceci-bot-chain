# Work Summary - July 14, 2025

## Overview
Today's work focused on fixing critical production issues and implementing export functionality for the Decision Guide bot.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed Full Content Display Issue
- **Problem**: Regular searches were showing full decision content even when not requested
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `full_content` parameter detection in unified intent bot
  - Modified backend to send empty content field when full content not requested
  - Only shows full content when user explicitly asks for "תוכן מלא"

### 2. Fixed Analysis Functionality  
- **Problem**: Analysis requests were returning empty responses
- **Solutions**:
  - Fixed intent detection to recognize both 'EVAL' and 'ANALYSIS' intents
  - Added data structure flattening in LLM formatter for analysis responses
  - Improved error handling to prevent empty responses
  - Analysis now properly displays evaluation results

### 3. Fixed Response Truncation
- **Problem**: Long responses were being cut off mid-sentence
- **Solution**: Increased LLM formatter MAX_TOKENS from 2000 to 4000
- **Result**: Complete responses for queries with 10+ results

### 4. Implemented Decision Guide Export Features
- **PDF Export**:
  - Visual score representation with circular gauge
  - Color-coded score bars (green/yellow/red)
  - Individual criteria scores with visual bars
  - Weight percentages and summary section
  - English text to avoid RTL complexity
  
- **CSV/Excel Export**:
  - Main sheet with all criteria data
  - Hebrew column headers
  - Includes scores, weights, explanations, quotes, and improvements
  - Separate recommendations sheet
  - Auto-sized columns for readability

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `bot_chain/UNIFIED_INTENT_BOT_1/main.py` - Added full_content parameter extraction
- `server/src/services/botChainService.ts` - Fixed full content handling
- `bot_chain/LLM_FORMATTER_BOT_4/main.py` - Fixed analysis formatting
- `src/services/exportService.ts` - Implemented PDF and CSV export
- `src/services/decisionGuide.service.ts` - Updated interface types

### Dependencies Added
- `xlsx` (v0.18.5) - For Excel export functionality

## Deployment Status
All changes have been deployed to production:
- Branch: `production-deploy`
- Server: 178.62.39.248
- Live at: https://ceci-ai.ceci.org.il

## Testing Results
- Full content display: ✅ Only shows when explicitly requested
- Analysis functionality: ✅ Properly formats and displays results
- Long responses: ✅ No longer truncated
- PDF export: ✅ Generates visual report with scores
- Excel export: ✅ Creates structured data sheets

## Known Issues Remaining
1. UNCLEAR routes don't trigger Clarify bot
2. RESULT_REF routes don't retrieve context properly
3. Cache systems need safe restoration
4. Reference Resolution needs implementation

## Next Steps
1. Test export features with real user data
2. Consider adding Hebrew font support for PDF
3. Implement remaining route fixes
4. Restore cache functionality safely
