# Decision Guide Bot Improvements Summary

## Date: 2025-07-23

### Problem Statement
User reported that the Decision Guide Bot was giving inconsistent results for the same 72-page document:
- Sometimes rejected as "טקסט כללי ולא מובנה"
- Sometimes passed validation but failed during analysis
- Sometimes completed successfully with different scores each time

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Token Limits**: 72-page document (~178KB) uses approximately 102K tokens, which approaches GPT-4o's context limit
2. **Non-deterministic Behavior**: GPT responses varied due to:
   - No temperature control (was using default)
   - No seed parameter for consistency
   - No caching of results

### Implemented Solutions

#### 1. Document Size Limits and Warnings
- Added size checking with two thresholds:
  - **Warning Limit**: 50,000 chars (~20 pages) - continues with warning
  - **Maximum Limit**: 100,000 chars (~40 pages) - rejects document
- User-friendly Hebrew messages explaining limits
- Size warnings added to recommendations when applicable

#### 2. Consistency Improvements
- Set `temperature=0.0` for deterministic scoring
- Added `seed=42` parameter to OpenAI API calls
- Ensures same document gets same analysis results

#### 3. Analysis Result Caching
- Implemented analysis cache with 1-hour expiry
- Documents are fingerprinted using MD5 hash
- Cached results include full analysis response
- Dramatically improves response time for repeated queries

#### 4. Enhanced Logging
- Added document hash tracking for debugging
- Token usage logging for all API calls
- Cache hit/miss logging

### Code Changes

**File: `/bot_chain/DECISION_GUIDE_BOT/main.py`**

1. Added configuration constants:
```python
# Document size limits
WARN_CHAR_LIMIT = 50000  # ~20 pages
MAX_CHAR_LIMIT = 100000  # ~40 pages
CHUNK_SIZE = 40000  # Size for each chunk when splitting
```

2. Added analysis caching:
```python
analysis_cache = {}  # Cache for analysis results
CACHE_EXPIRY_SECONDS = 3600  # 1 hour
```

3. Document size checking in `analyze_decision`:
```python
if doc_length > MAX_CHAR_LIMIT:
    return AnalyzeResponse(
        recommendations=[f"המסמך ארוך מדי ({doc_length:,} תווים)..."],
        retry_status="מסמך גדול מדי"
    )
```

4. OpenAI API consistency parameters:
```python
temperature=0.0,  # Set to 0 for consistent scoring
seed=42  # Fixed seed for deterministic results
```

### Test Script
Created `test_decision_guide_improvements.py` to verify:
- Document size limit enforcement
- Consistency across multiple runs
- Cache performance improvement

### User Benefits
1. **Predictable Behavior**: Same document always gets same analysis
2. **Clear Feedback**: Users know when documents are too large
3. **Faster Response**: Cached results return instantly
4. **Better Reliability**: No more random rejections or score variations

### Next Steps (Not Yet Implemented)
1. **Document Chunking**: For documents over 100K chars, implement intelligent chunking
2. **Progress Indicators**: Show analysis progress for large documents
3. **Streaming Responses**: Stream partial results as analysis progresses

### Deployment Instructions
```bash
# Rebuild and deploy the Decision Guide Bot
docker compose build decision-guide-bot
docker compose up -d decision-guide-bot

# Test the improvements
python test_decision_guide_improvements.py
```

### Monitoring
- Watch for log entries with `doc_hash` to track specific documents
- Monitor cache hit rate via "Using cached analysis result" messages
- Check token usage to ensure we stay within limits
